# ai-pathfinder-uninformed
This project implements classic uninformed search algorithms for pathfinding on a 2D grid and visualizes the exploration process using Matplotlib animations. It is designed to understand how different search strategies explore a grid from a start (S) to a target (T) while avoiding obstacles.
